Character of Ossington Village: 

⦁	At its south end, Ossington starts at Queen Street and goes north, up a hill to Dundas Street. This area is a newly developing and vibrant part of town undergoing tremendous transition. 

⦁	From this intersection north to Dundas, Ossington is largely lined with low-rise retail storefronts. Most buildings along this stretch date to the 19th century, and many have been restored in their conversion into restaurants and trendy stores, which have attracted visitors from around the Greater Toronto Area and made the area a magnet for international tourists visiting Toronto. 

⦁	The Neighbourhood — above Queen up to Harrison, across Crawford out past Dovercourt — a place of creativity and tradition, leafiness and urbanity, density with breathing room, diversity with congeniality — efficient, convenient, walkable, replete with classic Toronto Victorian architecture and prized gardens — clean, safe, friendly, fun, supportive of all ages, backgrounds, lifestyles. 

⦁	The Ossington Strip — Toronto’s restaurant row, a city-wide destination distinctively prized for high-quality eclecticism — emerging from the entrepreneurial energy of the Strip’s business community — sustained by the Strip’s openness to the sky, its low-key, funky, intimate built form — fueled by visitors and residents on the Strip for relaxation, mystery, surprise, the latest, the artisanal, the funnest, the coolest. Restaurant Row intermingles here on the town square with providers for car, soul, body, wardrobe, house, health, business, mind, eye, garden. 

⦁	The Dundas Bend — a quirky segment of one of Toronto’s great corridors — a corridor stretching northwest through Beaconsfield, Davenport, Roncesvalles, the Junction, and beyond; leading east past beautiful Trinity-Bellwoods Park, Kensington, Chinatown, through the heart of Downtown, and over the Don River out to the Beach — with a vibrant mix of locally-owned main street businesses and restaurants. 

For more information about Ossington Village’s restaurants, festivals, nightlife, theatre and art, please visit: http://ossingtonvillage.com 


Trinity Bellwoods Park    –   is a site for many cultural events, including a bookfair, live theatre, performance art, informal summer drumming circles, and features the Trinitiy Bellwoods Farmers Market (www.tbfm.ca).   The park is the site for an annual art sale in September as part of the Queen West Art Crawl.    The alleys and laneways which surround Trinity Bellwoods park have become an impromptu art gallery open to the public for one weekend in August for the past four years:    Alley Jaunt. 


TRINITY BELLWOODS PARK    -    is also home to the Trinity Bellwoods Recreational Centre  (with indoor pool and vast recreational programs) as well as to the Trinity Bellwoods Outdoor Ice Rink. www.trinitybellwoods.ca

Title:
Queen West 1 Bedroom Apartment for Rent

Rent out this charming apartment located in the heart of hip and trendy Queen West. In one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in Toronto. Surrounded by cafés, cool restaurants and trendy stores, this neighbourhood has it all. It is also located within steps of the ever-popular Trinity Bellwoods Park – all of this giving this location a Walk Score of 95.  

It also has a Transit Score of 100 due to the many frequent streetcars that run along Queen West (501).  

The living space itself does not disappoint. Occupying the whole floor on top of a store front. Features include:
•	1 Bedroom
•	2 other rooms that can be used as another bedroom, living room or office.
•	Full kitchen with fridge and stove.
•	Bathroom with shower and tub
•	Terrace deck at the back, perfect for just chilling on those cool summer nights
•	Central air conditioning

Does not include en-suite washer/dryer. There is a coin laundry, right across the street.

Somethings to consider living on Queen West and on top of a store front:
1.	There will be streetcar noise throughout the day/night.
2.	There will not be consistent hot water from 8am to 3pm because the building only has one hot water tank and the store underneath the apartment will be using majority of the hot water during those times.
3.	There is a bar/restaurant located right beside the apartment and there will be noise until 1am daily.

Available September 14.

Asking for $2000 per month, includes all utilities (gas, hydro, water).

Sorry, non-smokers only.

Seeking clean, quiet, mature tenant(s) for a one bedroom basement apartment in the DuWest neighbourhood. Women preferred

The unit is available for move in on September 1st. Available for viewing by appointment.

We offer: A quiet, clean basement apartment on Dufferin Street between College and Dundas. This location is close to everything with several TTC routes at your doorstep (the Dufferin bus, Dundas and College streetcars, as well as the Bloor subway line). We are 5 minutes from Dufferin Mall and Dufferin Grove Park, and close to Trinity Bellwoods Park (great picnic & barbeque potential). And we’re in walking distance to Little Italy, the Ossington strip, and the West Queen West gallery district. Local food stores include a 24-hour Metro, a Price Chopper, and two No Frills, not to mention some great small businesses including delis, coffee shops, and bakeries.

We DO allow small pets such as cats, but sorry no dogs. If you have allergies you should know there are 4 cats in the house (in the ground and 2nd floor units). Though they do not enter the basement apartment the house has one heating and ventilation system.

Rent for the basement unit is $1300.00/month. This includes heat, hydro, water, and trash collection. Cable & WiFi are NOT included. Neither is laundry (but there are several clean local laundromats, including one right beside The Common). If two people wish to share the apartment then the rent is  $1450/month because of additional use of hot water, electricity and trash collection.

The fine print:

The apartment has a separate back entrance accessed by a path along the side of the house and through a locked gate that leads to the back yard.

The apartment includes a large eat-in kitchen that doubles as the living space (tiled floor), and has a 3-piece bathroom (shower only, no tub).

The unit has laminate flooring in the bedroom.

The apartment comes unfurnished.

Parking, if required, is by street permit. 

Finally, this is a 100% smoke-free home as the landlord suffers severe asthma. Smoking of any kind (including 420) anywhere on the property will not tolerated.

Accessibility: Not great. There are at least 5 exterior steps down, and maybe 3 more interior steps, as well as an angled door into the small bathroom. As we both deal with anxiety issues (and one of us has a hearing disability), we tend to prefer text and/or email communication. Feel free to DM with further inquiries or for more details.

I moved into an amazing building near Yonge/Bloor. It's right at the corner of Bloor/Ted Rogers. I was looking for a studio/bachelor in the area and visited most of the units that were available. Every unit in that area for a studio was either beyond small or the building was old and severely depressing. There is a building called Residence on Bloor which I found and it rocks! The studio is actually very spacious inside, brand new, renovated, A/C, really nice hallways, pool, gym, Starbucks downstairs.

My company moved further away from the area, so I need to relocated. I am doing a lease assignment. First come first serve. Showing the unit this week. If interested, you will need to submit an application to the building management. I wouldn't have moved as I love the building, but need to move to be closer to my office.

It's available for September 1st. Rent is $1735    ","Ted Rogers Way, Toronto, ON M4Y

Live in our cozy home for the year 2020! We are newlywed travellers who are looking for a one year sublet for their perfect apartment on the west side. We love this place and we hope you will too.

Share the house (and a sweet backyard) with three other units of respectful young professionals (who are also really cool!).

The main-floor unit comes fully furnished with a large sectional, queen size pillow top mattress, Apple TV, and 48"" flatscreen TV. In-suite laundry. High-speed internet, utilities and Netflix included.

1 + den (complete with futon and privacy curtain), sunny office space and covered patio. The location is unreal for transportation with the 505, 506 and the Lansdowne 47 bus steps away and the Lansdowne subway station a 12 minute walk north.

We are looking for someone we can trust – who can enjoy this space while we're gone :-)

This charming 2 bedroom home in the heart of Toronto's Leslieville is steps to trendy 'Queen street' which is lined with many shops, bars, restaurants. Quiet small street, but close to everything and anything you may want to see. We have a parking spot for one car, an enclosed backyard, 2 big bedrooms: master has a queen size bed, walk in closet, dresser, the second bedroom is a double with lots of closet space and cozy. We spend the most time in our newly renovated kitchen, bright and warm, we love to entertain and cook. Our living room is bright and warm and we love watching Netflix or TV curled up on the sofa. A large dining table sits 6 comfortably but we have had dinners for 10. Lots of public transportation is close by that takes you to the Eaton Centre, CN Tower, museums, and Toronto's Harbourfront. We love our home and our neighbourhood, and also love to travel. We love our city. There is so much to see and do in our own neighbourhood by foot... Cheese market, unique shops, craft beer breweries, and some of the best reviewed restaurants in the city. By public transportation, a bus stop one block away takes you Toronto's Harbourfront (10min) there, you can walk along the water, experience cruises to Toronto islands, enjoy many paths and walking trials, and access Aquarium, CN Tower, Skydome (pro baseball stadium) and the Air Canada Centre (concert venue). There are streetcars that run across the city on Queen street, so if your feet get tired of walking, you can hop on a streetcar and go as far as you want to go.

We are relocating for a year to Kingston, and although taking most of our furniture, we are open to offering partial furnished if this easier. Can discuss details. Please let me know if you would like to schedule a viewing.

2BR/ 1 Ba, @1500 sq. ft. apartment, available Immediately, W/D in unit.

Modern Upper floor apartment in a 2 unit bungalow, open concept dining room, living room, kitchen with island, central heat, air conditioning, dishwasher, huge kitchen pantry, ample closet space, private enclosed large garden - 133 Manning Ave. 

This is a @1,500 square-foot home located steps from Toronto’s beautiful and ultra cool Trinity Bellwoods Park, a hub of cultural activity in one of the most SOUGHT AFTER AND FRIENDLY neighbourhoods in all of Toronto. This rental gem puts you within a short stroll of Toronto’s funky downtown while providing a quiet sanctuary to escape to when only home will do.

Landlord is looking for AAA tenants only.

Inside 133 Manning you’ll find a spacious, loft-like living room. Connected to the living room is the freshly renovated open concept kitchen and dining room featuring granite counters, fine European cabinetry, huge pantry, and dishwasher. Effortless. Elegant. Enjoyable.

The master bedroom has two large closets and two wardrobes with more than enough room for you to store all your clothing and linens, while the view of the colourful garden will remind you that quiet, cozy places exist even in the heart of hip downtown Toronto! A second bedroom sports a large closet.

The newly renovated bathroom gets bathed in the day’s light courtesy of a skylight, while you get to bathe under a rain showerhead with good, reliable water pressure. Such simple conveniences make daily living a pleasure, as does the complete laundry suite with front-loading washer and dryer and built-in drying rack. The rickety old machine at the public laundromat you were once forced to use will become a dark, distant memory.

When the weather’s right enjoy a short bike ride to work. Want to walk? Stroll over to the park for a picnic, JUMP ONTO THE STREETCAR, BUS, or NEARBY subway for quick access to all of Toronto – anytime, anywhere within minutes! *WALKING SCORE OF 91, 1 minute walk to 505 Dundas Street streetcar.

Toronto is one of the world’s great cities and there is simply no better way to enjoy it than living in its epicentre. Enjoy that proximity without the noise and the crowding that spoils other rental locations: 133 Manning Ave. is your oasis amidst everything wonderful that Toronto has to offer.

I’m house-sitting my aunt’s house in North York until May 31, 2020, so while I live there I’m subletting my FABULOUS, all-inclusive 1 bedroom, 1 full bathroom, 600sq ft apartment. The apartment is available September 1st 2019 - May 31st 2020* - perfect for a student! As the apartment is move-in ready, this place is ideal for the student that will be arriving in Toronto with just their acceptance letter and a suitcase - the apartment has everything you need to live comfortably.

The apartment is walking distance from the University of Toronto, Ryerson University and George Brown College! Rent is $2400 a month and includes the following:

- all utilities (heat, electricity, water, A/C)
- high-speed wireless internet service
- all furniture in the apartment, includes: Living room has 2 couches, dining table/chairs, bookshelf, coffee table, side tables, display shelves and matching lamps with light decor; Kitchen is fully loaded kitchen and includes dishes, cookware, utensils; Bedroom has a queen sized bed with pillow top memory foam mattress and mattress cover, side table and lamp, lots of shelving, a fan, a large clothes closet and a large linen closet; Full bathroom includes new showerhead, shelving and cleaning supplies; Front hallway has a large closet and a set of colourful shelves. Balcony is complete with 2 large lounge chairs and 2 stools, comfortable AstroTurf flooring, a side table and a stunning view of the city!

Apartment also includes: cleaning supplies, bath towels, bed linens, and blankets and pillows for the bed - all new! (Previously I thought to put this on AirBnb so I bought a bunch of new stuff to load it up!)

The building has a large laundry room on the main floor (apartment includes a laundry card). Also on the main floor is a small gym and a small swimming pool. Evening and weekend security guards. There is NO parking at the building due to construction on the parking garage, however there is lots of parking on the street. Pets are negotiable. The building is located at the corner of Carlton St and Homewood Ave, right in the heart of downtown Toronto. It’s directly on a 24-hour streetcar route, short walking distance to two subway stations (College Station and Sherbourne Station). Grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants and pubs are all in short walking distance. Across the street is a large, pretty park!

Please contact me for more information or to arrange a viewing.

My boyfriend and I are taking a trip for the month of September and are looking to sublet our apartment to someone/a couple! It’s a quaint and cozy studio apartment on the top level of a little building just south of King on Dufferin. 
It’s a quick walk to many amenities including Coffee Shops, Grocery Stores, Boutiques, Restaurants/Bars, Gym, Liberty Village, etc. The apartment has a 200 square foot balcony which sits on the roof and is just so beautiful to lay out on. The building has coin laundry in the basement or, if you prefer, there is a laundromat just down the street. 

The apartment includes a dishwasher, wifi, t.v, PS4 (I’ll leave my games out for ya and keep my Netflix account logged on too!) Kodi Box for movies that Netflix just can’t provide, double bed, 6 drawer dresser, freshly purchased linens and towels for you to use, other homey things and a peaceful and loving atmosphere ✌

Other than asking for the obvious, a respectful subletter (no party’s and noise levels down my 10ish) I would need someone to be able to water my plants as I would be so heartbroken to come back to dead greens (only a few plants, super easy!) 🌿

The 3 bedrooms available in shared 4 bedroom house rental is $2400. Does NOT include utilities. Available furnished or not, your preference. Also considering room rental for $800 each room furnished or without furnishings, your preference. Both options are shared and both have a one year lease requirement.

Private driveway holds up to 4 cars and plenty of free street parking in this area. (Please note additional parking fee is $100 per car).

Located between Kipling and Islington off Queensway. Quiet tree lined street, minutes to Bloor West area, close walking distance to Sobey's, cinema, restaurants, and a close drive to Sherway Gardens. Also close to TTC, metro Kipling station, Gardiner, QEW, 427 and just off highway so only 10 minutes any direction to get downtown, airport or Humber College. 

It's a 3 bedroom house with a large kitchen with island for kitchen enthusiasts, spacious living and dining room, lots of storage in bathroom and hallway. All bedrooms with locks on doors. There's a large front patio area and a private back patio with a really large yard and a garden area if maintained.

Great neighborhood to live in. So close to everything yet quiet and homey. Like living at the cottage but yet in a house. The house has a fairly updated late 2000's look that is close to everything so you can even take the metro up the street at the Kipling station. Recently painted inside and outside of the house. Driveway and back patio deck repaved as well.

As of yet, this does NOT include snow removal or gardening.  A lawnmower, gardening tools, electric snow remover and snow tools provided.  *Looking into both options now.

1 year lease required. After viewing there's a rental application to be filled out before checking credit (3x months of bank statements will suffice just to show bills paid on time, etc) and approval of lease. Please ONLY inquire if you are ok with a one year lease and price as we already reduced it with disclaimer that all utilities, cable/net bills NOT included. Thanks.

Move into a glorious, prime location fully furnished Rosedale residence! Available as of Sept 24, 2019, but won't last long - always gets snapped up as its such an unbeatable location.  $2950/month with upgraded parking and possibly less if you don't require parking. You will have exclusive, private, ""whole house"" use of the condo, with no shared rooms or bath. There is a shared building rooftop terrace to gather with neighbors and shared gym and party room.

Brand new top quality eco hardwood laminate floors installed in 2018 that are not in the photographs! This sprawling 1,025 square foot corner suite features soaring windows on two sides, 1 bedroom, 1 bath, easy breezy kitchen, open concept Great Room, ensuite laundry. Most impressive of all - a 1000 square foot bonus outdoor living space - a stunning terrace landscaped with maple tree, cherry tree, lilacs, peonies, boxwood and tulips! This terrace is totally private for your exclusive enjoyment. Bedroom features a plush, high end king size mattress and plenty of storage space. Ideally suited for an executive rental or couple that loves upscale living.

Former tenants rave about the joys of a sprawling PRIVATE green space, and a bedroom that feels like a REAL, proper bedroom, not a poor excuse for den or what passes for a bedroom in new build ""pack 'em in"" condos in the GTA.

The prestigious Ramsden building is literally across the intersection from the leafy green Rosedale TCC Subway stop - literally a 3 min walk. The building is mid-rise and there a limited number of suites so not a high-density building with high traffic and noise pollution. For a building in the heart of midtown, it is surprisingly serene. There is a precious residential integrity to this place that is hard to find anywhere else. The Ramsden is 90% owner occupied, so there is not that transient feeling of living in a skyscraper. Finding a rental unit at this building is rare! A peaceful community, perfect for commuters who also need quick access to the Yonge subway line.

Top notch walk score to nearby amenities and attractions - stroll to the global flagship Four Seasons Toronto, Royal Ontario Museum, the Mink Mile of haute shops like Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Cartier in under 15 minutes. Looking for a mindful, respectful tenant to enjoy the lifestyle here. Perfect for Yorkville, Rosedale, Terroni and Summerhill LCBO enthusiasts - it's time to pop the Moet Chandon on this terrace overlooking Rosedale! NON-SMOKERS only and NO PETS please, thanks.
