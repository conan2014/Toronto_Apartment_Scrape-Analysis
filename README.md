In this project, I scraped Craigslist apartment price and other associated info for the city of Toronto using Scrapy
(purely for selfish reason cuz I'm new to the city and doing apartment hunting at that time :) )

Unlike Craigslist website designed for other cities, Craigslist Toronto apartment listing page didn't contain 
correct neighborhood info. So I went ahead, scraped and parsed corresponding neighborhood data using Selenium
from latlong.net

In addition to exploratory data analysis, I also attempted to predict apartment price. 

Future directions for this project: set up email alert of the cheapest posts by desired neighborhood and apartment layout
as soon as they are posted.
