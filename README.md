In this project, I scraped Craigslist apartment prices and other associated info for the city of Toronto using Scrapy
(it was born out of practical reasons for I was new to the city and needed an apartment at that time )

Unlike Craigslist websites designed for other cities, Craigslist Toronto apartment listing page didn't contain 
correct neighborhood info. So I went ahead, scraped and parsed corresponding neighborhood data using Selenium
from latlong.net

In addition to exploratory data analysis, I also attempted to predict apartment price

Future directions for this project: set up email alerts of the cheapest posts by desired neighborhood and apartment layout
as soon as they are posted
